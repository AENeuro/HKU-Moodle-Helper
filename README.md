**This extension allows HKU students to pin your current courses (in a semester) on top of the page in HKU Moodle.**

By: Andrew Z

# ✨ How to use?

1. Click "Add to this semester" on a course
2. Voilà! You'll see the course on the top of the page. Under "Course of this semester".

🎉Moodle Helper now allows users to add any course they search for to the "Course of this semester" list. This means you can add courses from search results by course code, not just those listed on the homepage!

🎉Your semester list is synced across devices (any desktop chrome browser that is logged into the same Google account)

🎉After a semester ends, empty the list with one click.

# 🤔 FAQ

**1. I can't find one or some of my courses in Moodle!**

* Courses are usually added during Add & Drop Period or shortly after. Contact ITS or your course supervisor if you cannot find the entry to a course. This application does not make things appear or disappear.

**2. I can't pin a course that I manually found by searching the course code.**

* Unfortunately that's not feasible. This application pins what was already on your Moodle home page - it cannot do that if there isn't anything to pin in the first place.

**3. Is my information safe?**

* Very much so. This application does not collect personally identifiable information. The list of courses you choose to pin is sent only to your Google Account and is never accessible to the developer. I choose to open source the application so that anyone can audit what's going on in the backend. 

**3. How do I contribute or propose new functions?**

* Submit a feedback. Open an issue. Better yet, make a PR.
