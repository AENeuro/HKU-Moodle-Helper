This extension allows HKU students to show your current courses (in a semester) in a separate entry in HKU Moodle. 
By: Andrew Z

❓How to use?

1. Click "Add to this semester" on a course
2. Voilà! You'll see the course on the top of the page. Under "Course of this semester".

🎉Your semester list is synced across devices (any chrome browser that is logged into the same Google account)
🎉After a semester ends, click "Remove all courses from this semester" to empty the list.
🎉You can choose to "Remove from this semester" anytime!
